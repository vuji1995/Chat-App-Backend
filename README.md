# Chat-App-Backend

This chat app has its backend hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, while the frontend and socket.io server code require local installation. The socket.io server code is written in Node.js and utilizes the socket.io library to facilitate real-time communication. On the other hand, the frontend code is written in React and connects to the socket.io server through the socket.io client library. Both the frontend and socket.io server code are available on GitHub at the following links:
